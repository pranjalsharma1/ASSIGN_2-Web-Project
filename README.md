**Todo List App - WebTech Project**
**Created by: Pranjal Sharma**
**Introduction**
Hey there! Welcome to my Todo List Application, created as part of my Web Technologies (WebTech) project. This app allows you to manage your tasks in a simple and intuitive way. You can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them as needed. **It's built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

**This project was created to help me learn the core concepts of web development and how to interact with the browser using JavaScript, and I'm excited to share it with you!**

**Key Features**

**Add Tasks:** Simply type a task into the input field and hit "Add" to add it to your to-do list.
**Mark as Completed:** Click on any task to mark it as completed, and it’ll be moved to the completed section.
**Remove Tasks:** You can also remove tasks from both the to-do and completed lists.
**Technologies Used**
**HTML:** Used to create the structure of the app.
**CSS:** Styled the app to make it clean, simple, and responsive on various devices.
**JavaScript:** The magic behind making the app interactive—adding tasks, marking them as completed, and removing them from the list.
**How to Use**
**Clone or Download:** Grab the project by cloning or downloading the repository.

**Persistence:** Save your tasks even after the page refreshes using local storage.
**Reordering Tasks:** Add drag-and-drop functionality so you can reorder tasks as you wish.
**Edit Tasks: **Allow users to edit tasks after they've been added.
